Built on the .NET Framework, PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell
and scripting language; it is designed specifically for system administrators
and power-users, to rapidly automate the administration of multiple operating
systems (Linux, macOS, Unix, and Windows) and the processes related to the
applications that run on those operating systems.

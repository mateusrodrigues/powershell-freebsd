This port was first created as part of a Google Summer of Code 2018 project
by the current port maintainer. This powershell port is a preview version.

The dotnet System.Console assembly, therefore PowerShell itself - which depends
on it - requires an unhashed terminfo database to be located in the system's
default terminfo location (/usr/share/misc/terminfo for PowerShell) or somewhere
else provided it's explicit in the TERMINFO environment variable.

The current version of the .NET runtime requires the following environment variables
to be set. These are in order to disable crossgened version of assemblies that
currently target Linux and to enable support for HTTP Client that for now does
not find SSL certificates on FreeBSD by default:

export COMPlus_ZapDisable=1
export COMPlus_ReadyToRun=0

export SSL_CERT_FILE=/usr/local/share/certs/ca-root-nss.crt
export DOTNET_SYSTEM_NET_HTTP_USESOCKETSHTTPHANDLER=0

The following parameters are optional:

export DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE=1
export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
